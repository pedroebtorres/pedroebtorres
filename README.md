### Hi there 👋

## About me

<img align="right" src="/images/pedroebtorres.jpeg" width="200px">

My name is Pedro Torres. I live in Cacoal, a small town in Rondônia, Brazil. I had my first exposure to coding when I started to study Materials Engineering, after that I fell in love with it, then I decided to join Trybe and dedicate to coding.

In my free time, I like to run (🏃), I like to study foreign languages (📚) , I like to read philoshophy books (📚) and, sometimes, I like to watch some series (🎞️).
